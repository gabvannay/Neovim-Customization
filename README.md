## How to install

### Linux

1. [Head to *Neovim*'s GitHub](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md) and follow the instructions to download it, here's the example using the pre-built binaries

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/latest/download/nvim-linux64.tar.gz
sudo rm -rf /opt/nvim
sudo tar -C /opt -xzf nvim-linux64.tar.gz
```

... and then add the path to your `.bashrc`

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/nvim-linux64/bin"
```

2. Clone this repo into your config folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabvannay/Neovim-Customization.git ~/.config/nvim
```

3. Launch *Neovim* and the plugins should install automatically

```bash
nvim
```

### Windows

1. Make sure you have [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) installed by typing `choco -v` if you don't have any result, you can install it with the command below.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

2. First step is to install *gcc*, *clang* or *zig* compiler, the easiest one is *zig*

```powershell
choco install zig
```

3. Now it's time to install *Neovim* the easiest way is by using *winget*

```powershell
winget install --id=Neovim.Neovim -s winget
```

4. Clone this repo into your config folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabvannay/Neovim-Customization.git $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim
```

5. Launch *Neovim* and the plugins should install automatically

```bash
nvim
```
